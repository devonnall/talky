# Taskly
**A very simple to-do app built with Vue.js, Tailwind, and Pocketbase**

## Features
The feature set is rather limited, but currently you can:
- create tasks
- mark tasks as complete
- delete tasks

Tasks are automatically synced with the database. No reloading is necessary to see an updated task list.

## Potential Features
Features I may or may not add in the future include:
- editing tasks (fairly basic)
- creating projects
- starting "focus sessions" for individual tasks
- adding multiple tabs for different task categories (inbox, today, important, etc)

## What I Learned
Before this project I had no experience with Vue.js, working with databases, or state management. This was a really useful learning experience for developing a responsive yet very simple web application. I have also found that reactivity is more straightforward in Vue.js than it is in Next.js, which is the first JavaScript framework I started learning. 

I also learned that I LOVE Tailwind.
